## 🧠 About the Project

This bot monitors the **XAU/USD (Gold)** forex market autonomously 24/5. Rather than relying on lagging indicators, it implements core **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)** logic. It processes `15-Minute` candles to determine the macro bias and `5-Minute` candles to isolate surgical entry triggers. 

When a confluence of signals aligns with strict risk-management parameters, it formats a comprehensive report detailing the entry, exact stop loss, take profit, and the precise reasoning behind the trade—delivered instantly to your Telegram.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithmic Strategy

The bot scores potential trade setups out of 100 based on multiple confluences:

1. **Market Structure (BOS / CHoCH)**: Analyzes the last 60 candles to map swing highs and lows.
2. **Liquidity Grabs**: Identifies aggressive wick rejections beyond recent extremes.
3. **Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**: Detects impulsive momentum and structural imbalances.
4. **Key S&R Levels**: Calculates dynamic Support and Resistance zones.
5. **Price Action Patterns**: Engulfing candles, Hammers, and Shooting Stars.
6. **RSI Divergence**: Uses standard 14-period RSI to validate overbought/oversold extremes.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Lot Sizing**: Strictly adheres to a predefined risk profile (e.g., exactly 3% of capital per trade).
- **Capital Adequacy Checks**: Gold is volatile. The bot mathematically verifies if your account balance can handle the minimum lot size for a specific setup's stop-loss. If the risk is too high, it dynamically rejects the trade.
- **Paper Trading Mode**: Safety-first testing. Generates "Paper Signals" for forward-testing without risking live capital.
- **Session Awareness**: Operates aware of Asian, London, and New York overlapping sessions.

## 🛠️ Requirements & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- A Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- A TwelveData API Key (for real-time XAU/USD data)

### Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/XAU-USD-Signal-Bot.git
   cd XAU-USD-Signal-Bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the script:**
   Inside `bot.py`, locate the Configuration block and update your risk settings:
   ```python
   CAPITAL = 200               # Your exact real balance
   RISK_PERCENT = 0.05         # 5% risk per trade ($10)
   MAX_TRADES_PER_DAY = 10     # Daily signal cap
   MIN_CONFIDENCE = 65         # Confluence threshold
   SKIP_SESSIONS = []          # Optional session filter, e.g. ["London Session 🇬🇧"]
   PAPER_MODE = True           # Set False ONLY when ready for live execution
   ```

4. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## 🔑 Environment Variables

To keep your credentials secure, do **not** hardcode them. Export these environment variables locally or input them into your hosting provider's dashboard:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` | The HTTP API token from BotFather. |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Your personal ID or Channel ID where signals will be sent. |
| `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY` | Free API key from TwelveData to pull candlestick data. |

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is fully pre-configured for seamless cloud deployment to ensure 24/5 uptime.

### Railway.app (Recommended)
This repository includes a `railway.json` and `Procfile`. 
1. Link your GitHub repository to a new Railway project.
2. Add your Environment Variables in the Railway Dashboard.
3. The bot will deploy and run automatically.

---

## 🧪 Backtesting

The repo ships with two validation tools (data is cached in `logs/backtest_cache/`, ~4 API credits per run on the TwelveData free plan):

```bash
python backtest.py --days 60   # bar-by-bar simulation of the live loop on real 5M/15M candles
python ablation.py             # A/B compare config variants (confidence, session filter, sizing)
```

`backtest.py` replays `generate_signal()` exactly as the live bot calls it — same 100-bar windows, same cooldown/daily-limit/session filters — enters at the next bar's open, and resolves SL/TP using bar highs/lows (SL wins ties). Outputs: `logs/backtest_summary.json` and `logs/backtest_trades.jsonl`.

> ⚠️ Results assume ~$0.40 round-trip spread/slippage is **not** included; the strategy's edge is thin after costs. Always keep `PAPER_MODE = True` until you have validated live.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Educational Purposes Only.** Trading Gold (XAU/USD) involves significant risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. The algorithms provided in this repository do not constitute financial advice. Always use `PAPER_MODE` before engaging in live markets. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
